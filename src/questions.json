      "feedback": "While there are conditions for which fish oil can be recommended by a doctor, fish oil can be dangerous to someone with a heart condition—for example, if they have a defibrillator inserted, it can cause irregular heartbeats—and it can lower the body’s immune response. Many over-the-counter fish oils contain contaminants that are harmful to the body or simply costly and ineffective. See, for example, https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-993/fish-oil"

      "question": "Jim stops taking his antibiotics for a persistent infection against his doctor’s wishes because he thinks a more ‘natural’ option like vitamins is healthier for him.

      "feedback": "It’s easy to think that once you start to feel better you are cured, and just as easy to attribute it to alternative medicines. However, feeling better does not mean you are cured and can just mean the condition will return with greater severity. Prescriptions are designed not only to make you feel better but to eliminate the condition entirely or prevent it from returning.
